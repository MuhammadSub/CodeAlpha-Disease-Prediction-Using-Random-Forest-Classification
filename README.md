# Disease Prediction Using Random Forest Classification

## Project Overview
This project leverages the power of machine learning, specifically the Random Forest Classification algorithm, to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on patient data. The goal is to build a robust model that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and selects important features.
- Model Training: Trains a Random Forest Classifier using labeled data.
- Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Prediction: Provides disease predictions based on new input data.
- Visualization: Includes visualizations for feature importance, model performance, and prediction results.
